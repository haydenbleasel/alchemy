# Alchemy

A visual journey of The Alchemist, powered by OpenAI and Midjourney.

I started by creating a list of artworks that I wanted to create, based on scenes from the book I thought were particularly evocative.

Having chosen Romanticism as the style, I then used OpenAI's ChatGPT 4o to generate a prompt for each artwork.

I then passed the prompts to Midjourney v6.1 to generate the artworks.
